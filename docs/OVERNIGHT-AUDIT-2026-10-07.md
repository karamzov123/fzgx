# New fzgx: completion audit and overnight operating plan

Date: 2026-10-07. Target: `/home/armandofm/projects/fzgx`, branch `main`.
This is the new matching-decomp project, not gx-forge or legacy NATC. This document distinguishes measured evidence, implemented changes, and future experiments. It is not a claim of global optimality or an estimate that the project can finish tonight.

## Measured baseline

- The current build passed `ninja -j4 build/GFZE01/ok` and `build/tools/dtk shasum -q -c config/GFZE01/build.sha1`: **16 files OK**. `fzgx lint`: **0 findings**.
- The prior `honest` command silently excluded the DOL because it searched only configuration subdirectories. Fixed root `main` symbol/split discovery and `src/dol` object accounting, with a failing-then-passing fixture regression test. `.init` functions are counted too. No retail/auto split receives authored credit just because it links.
- Full known-symbol baseline: **7,308** nonzero functions, **5,692** authored, **1,616** not authored; **1,126,920 / 2,924,488 bytes = 38.5339%**. A smaller credited-minus-authored discrepancy remains intentionally visible.
- DTK reports **2,937,044 text-code bytes**, leaving **12,556 bytes** outside the known-function-size denominator. Completing `honest` alone does not prove every executable byte has a source owner. Reconcile this gap before declaring project completion.
- Remaining known bytes: **1,797,568**. `main_rel` accounts for **55.99%**. Functions over 2 KB account for **709,472 remaining bytes**. The existing size gate cannot be the permanent completion strategy.
- Local-attempt accounting found no virgin unmatched functions below 1 KB; there are **294** virgin 1–2 KB functions and **181** virgin functions above 2 KB. Repeatedly mining exhausted small functions is not the primary next phase.
- Seven-day historical terminal results (observational, different target difficulty; not a fair model contest): Claude Opus 5.5: 42/151; GPT 6.1-Sol: 125/805; AGY Gemini 3.8: 24/117; Space Bunny oc1: 26/145; oc4: 31/147. Null-model/error rows are separate in the snapshot. Terminal matches must still be distinguished from verified delivery.

The repeatable evidence source is `tools/fleet_audit.py`, using only the authoritative `.fzgx/ledger.db` opened read-only. Do not use the untracked `state/fzgx.db`; it is not this project's ledger. Historical rate statistics include overhead and are not an ETA.

## Model discovery and actual trials

Installed CLIs were inspected: OpenCode 1.18.35 (pinned for `--pure`), system OpenCode 2.0.0, Claude 3.5.0, Codex 0.160.1, AGY 1.13.5. The installed OpenCode catalog includes `opencode/fledge-alpha-free`.

- Fledge Alpha: a real function-bound CLI trial on `fn_14_6044`, max 6 checks, ended in 9.8 s with **FreeTierError 403**, before any checks. Provider: “OpenCode's free tier can only be used from within OpenCode.” This was already the official CLI. Do not claim model incompetence from this, spoof provider headers, or enable shell/filesystem tools to pass provider admission. Root cause is not definitively established. Official OpenCode issue #49433 discusses related failures.
- Space Bunny control on `fn_1_210A8`: 274 s, **0 checks**, 31,999 reasoning tokens, ended `length`. It responded but did not execute a tool call. Not a successful decomp trial. A preceding mistyped-symbol invocation failed assignment and was excluded as model evidence.
- Both free lanes are held for 24 hours for review. Fledge remains an explicit experimental model pin, not a silent alias/fallback. Cline's withdrawn OpenRouter Space Bunny model stays off.
- Corrected mixed-model routing: shared OpenCode agent configuration is now model-independent; each command has an explicit `--model`. Existing `--pure`, denied built-ins, six bound tools, and no subagents remain intact.
- Corrected surge accounting: reserve actual configured sessions, not one slot per family. Admission also enforces the global ceiling.

Provider documentation: https://opencode.ai/docs/zen/ and https://opencode.ai/data/unknown/fledge-alpha . Fledge may use collected trial data for model improvement; Space Bunny's published policy says zero-retention/no training. No credential values were printed or added to prompts. Do not infer the real vendor behind a stealth name.

## Implemented overnight route and laptop envelope

- Main route: **Claude Opus 5.5 High ×2**, **GPT 6.1-Sol Medium ×2**, **AGY Gemini 3.8 High ×1**. Preserve the established, explicit AGY quota fallback mechanism; do not add a new hidden paid API fallback.
- Free reserve: oc1 Fledge and oc4 Space Bunny, one session each, held as above. They are not promoted merely because their price is zero. Existing surge policy remains dependent on measured paid-provider availability.
- Global session ceiling **8**. systemd envelope: **6 CPU equivalents**, CPU/IO weight 25, nice 10, MemoryHigh **8 GiB**, MemoryMax **10 GiB**, TasksMax **768**. The laptop has 22 logical CPUs and about 14 GiB RAM; this leaves headroom for desktop, compiler bursts, and unrelated services rather than assuming idle RAM is all available to agents.
- Pause admission below **2 GiB available host RAM**, **8 GiB disk free**, **100,000 free inodes**, at **90 C** or hotter, or at **25% battery off AC**. These are admission controls: existing bounded sessions drain, not an instantaneous thermal kill switch. cgroup limits protect the outer resource envelope.
- Existing session bounds remain: 16 checks, 5 stale checks, 1,800 s/session, bounded turns, serialized build/tool calls, live verification, provider reset-aware cooldowns, and no blind attempt-cap bypass except established evidence tiers. Cumulative cached input token limits are not reintroduced: earlier measured limits killed productive sessions.
- Pre-existing operator edits in `src/rel/pilotpoint/pilotpoint.c` are preserved. The entire pilotpoint module is excluded from autonomous dispatch for this daemon run, preventing workers' file commits from absorbing those edits. Existing modified `fleet_multi.py`, `fleet_cline.mjs`, and untracked model probes were not discarded.
- `fzgx-fleet.service` runs independently of this terminal, with its existing automatic restart and bounded SIGTERM drain. It is started, not newly enabled at every boot.
- `fzgx-awake.service` holds an actual login1 sleep/idle inhibitor and is bound to the fleet service. Keep the laptop plugged in, ventilated, and preferably with its lid open. Manual suspend, network loss, or a critical battery event can still interrupt work.
- New `fzgx-audit.timer` updates an atomic read-only snapshot every 30 minutes without a model request. It does not claim to send notifications to this CLI session.

The Oracle VM is **aarch64, 2 CPUs, 6.7 GiB RAM**, with **only 231 MB free on a 30 GB root filesystem (100%)**, and existing services/swap use. It is excluded tonight. No files/services were deleted or changed on the VM. Cleanup and independent storage headroom are prerequisites to using it for dashboards, artifact hosting, or isolated compilation; adding a fleet to that host now is unsafe. Never run desktop OAuth credentials on a public website worker or upload retail binaries to public storage.

## Best path to completion: ordered workstreams

### 1. Deliver verified bytes, not large match-count headlines

Continue subscribed-model work on fresh 1–2 KB bodies and bounded structural repairs. Track verified authored bytes per wall-clock day, pending versus verified candidates, null-tool sessions, and blocked transport time. Do not use pooled terminal success or function-count completion as the sole dashboard. Existing live verifier and hash gate are stronger than post-hoc model claims. Keep object-equal/link-unequal cases out of matcher dispatch; use `why-link` with a reproducible link delta instead.

### 2. Graduate to large-function structural recovery

After observing the current night, run stratified, compiler-backed trials on virgin >2 KB bodies, at **one** expert session initially. Measure bytes delivered and wall time against the current 1–2 KB route; expand the size gate only on evidence. For large functions, build compact control-flow, field-offset, call-signature, literal-pool, and loop-shape evidence before spending checks. Use existing structmap/flagcell/lifter/constraint/capture tooling; do not proliferate disconnected duplicate harnesses.

Prioritized byte-heavy targets include `fn_1_BC310` (9,832 B), `fn_1_C4ABC` (9,240 B), DOL `fn_8005DCEC` (7,920 B), customize `fn_3_15A0` (7,680 B), `fn_1_10E3B4` (7,252 B), and `fn_1_120804` (6,980 B). These are a measured backlog, **not assigned tasks or permission to exceed current worker scope**. Pilotpoint stays quarantined until its operator edits are resolved.

### 3. Preserve and route compiler knowledge rather than regenerate it

The current assignment already delivers target assembly, exact flags/data bytes, sibling declarations, best body, real residual rows, previous failed edits, and compiler idioms. Keep this evidence flow. Near-miss tasks should start from the saved best body and a stated structural hypothesis; virgin tasks should start from a bounded draft. Avoid giant universal notes and repeated declaration-order sweeps, especially where the assignment records thousands of previous variants. Improve the existing selective knowledge path only with measured prompt/tool-call results. Convert reproducible captures and matching deltas into compact version/compiler-specific lessons, not global assertions about MWCC.

### 4. Benchmark genuinely new models safely

Discover through installed CLI catalogs and official provider pages, not search snippets alone. A catalog entry is availability metadata, not a capability proof. Require a tool-call/permission probe, then fixed representative decomp tasks with the same contexts, budgets, and correctness oracle; log actual model identity and compare difficulty strata. For matched-function controls, avoid handing the model the finished source as the answer. Do not use an API wrapper to evade a CLI-only free tier. Trial Nous/OpenRouter pools or new stealth releases only through an authenticated, proven six-tool transport, with public/non-secret context and no unsanctioned paid fallback. No arbitrary subagents in matcher sessions.

### 5. Close source ownership and module organization

The endgame includes DOL/SDK/compiler helper ownership, literal pools, cross-module imports, remaining C translation-unit grouping, data ownership, and the 12,556-byte denominator gap. `tu-migrate`, source alignment, and compatible reference research are specialist work, not reason to let every matcher modify build flags. C bodies must be portable within the approved project conventions, not wholesale asm, raw opcode arrays, register-name locals, or fabricated 100% markers. Keep immutable retail assets out of commits. A complete source build must independently reproduce all sixteen targets.

## Permissions and tooling policy

Matcher tools remain exactly `write_unit`, `patch_unit`, `check`, `read_evidence`, `submit`, `release`, bound to the runner-assigned function. No claim/inventory/context/shell/web/files or delegation tools. Supervisor controls capacity and routes; compiler/verifier decides success. No queue-pointer guessing, blanket approval, credential scraping, or automatic public publishing of retail bytes. New errors get classified, not counted as attempts to decompile successfully.

New maintained repository artifacts: `tools/fleet_audit.py` and `tools/systemd/` unit templates. Per AGENTS.md's no-repository-unit-tests rule, the seven controller/accounting regressions live outside the repository in `/home/armandofm/.local/share/fzgx-audit/tests/`; they passed after demonstrating relevant failures before fixes. Real bound model/compiler sessions, lint, and the full sixteen-target gate remain the repository acceptance evidence. One attempted `fzgx selftest` command is not supported by this CLI and is not counted as a passing gate.

## Morning inspection and safe stop

From `/home/armandofm/projects/fzgx`:

    .venv/bin/python tools/fleet.py status
    .venv/bin/python tools/fleet_audit.py --output .fzgx/overnight-latest.json
    .venv/bin/python tools/fzgx.py honest --closure
    .venv/bin/python tools/fzgx.py lint
    ninja -j4 build/GFZE01/ok
    build/tools/dtk shasum -q -c config/GFZE01/build.sha1
    journalctl --user -u fzgx-fleet.service -n 50 --no-pager

Compare `.fzgx/overnight-baseline-20261007.json` with `.fzgx/overnight-latest.json`. Latest state is atomically replaced, not a cumulative narrative log.

Safe stop:

    systemctl --user stop fzgx-fleet.service

Allow up to 300 seconds for the existing drain protocol; do not kill the compiler or clear the ledger. The awake inhibitor stops with the fleet. Optional stop for the read-only periodic monitor:

    systemctl --user disable --now fzgx-audit.timer

The existing publisher correctly refuses a dirty source tree. Operator source edits were not committed just to make auto-publishing succeed; local verified worker commits can continue. Tooling and this audit are committed locally under the shared submission lock; the controller commit includes the already-present model-withdrawal/backoff and batch-wave changes it builds upon, without discarding them. No promise of a clean tree or pushed audit commit is made while intentional pre-existing source/client changes remain.
