"""Classify the differing rows of the near-miss band by *what kind* of difference they are.

`fzgx stuck --min-percent N` labels a plateaued body with a mode -- `regalloc`, `imm`,
`schedule`, `frame`, `reloc` -- and the >=99% band is 109/135 `regalloc`. That label is
the objdiff row category, not a source shape: parsing all 395 differing rows across the
60 closest functions shows 59% are the same mnemonic with a different register, and that
those split into at least three unrelated causes (a return value in the wrong register, a
calleee-saved pair swapped, an address base chosen differently). See
docs/findings/285.

This exists so the distribution can be re-measured as the band drains, instead of being
re-derived by hand -- and so the next person asking "is regalloc one shape?" gets the
split in one command rather than a wrong answer in one.

    python3 tools/fzgx/shapecensus.py --min-percent 99 --limit 60 [--json]

Read-only: compiles each saved best body at the module default and reads objdiff's rows.
Two traps this had to be written around, both of which look like real results:

  * `oracle.check(..., 0, ...)` returns **zero** diff rows, not unlimited ones. Passing
    0 yields an empty census that reads as "no differences", so a real limit is required.
  * a diff row contains *both* sides (`target | ours`). Grepping the whole row matches
    retail's text; only the text after the pipe is our output.
