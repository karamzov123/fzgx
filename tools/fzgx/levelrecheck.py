"""Re-probe the recorded per-function optimisation levels against *current* bodies.

`fzgx levelscan` (docs/LEVELSCAN.md) measured 269 functions whose saved body scores better
under a level other than the module default, and recorded the winning level in
`state/compiler_options.json`. `_compiler_options` already feeds that level to every check,
so the levels are not sitting unused -- but the measurement is a snapshot, and the fleet
rewrites bodies continuously. A level that was best for October's body can be wrong for
November's, and nothing in the tree notices.

So this reports the question the snapshot cannot: **for each recorded level, does the body
that exists right now actually score better at it?** Three outcomes per symbol:

  confirmed  the recorded level still wins against the current body
  stale      the current default now wins; the recorded level is wrong for this body
  gone       no body, or nothing compiles, so there is nothing to re-probe

Reports only. It never writes unit options and never reconfigures the build: applying a
level is `_set_unit_opts` plus `_reconfigure_and_split`, which mutates shared build state
and must not race the live fleet. Harvesting a confirmed level is `fzgx sweep --land`, and
submit already persists the level through the unit record (api.submit -> _set_unit_opts), so
a level-based match is link-stable rather than an object-only coincidence.

Read-only by construction: compiles into a temporary directory and touches nothing else.

**Measured result (2026-10-04), and a correction to the plan this came from.** All 269 recorded
levels were re-probed against the bodies that exist now:

    checked 269   confirmed 268   stale 1 (fn_4_B528, -O3 lost 2.7)   gone 0

So the levels are not stale and are being applied correctly -- `_compiler_options` already
feeds them to every check, and 268 of 269 still win against the current body. **But not one
of the 268 reaches a match.** The best is `fn_8003D42C` at 89.19% (from 7.89%), and the
whole confirmed set is under 90%.

The plan this answered predicted a cheap harvest here. That was wrong, and the reason is
worth recording so nobody re-runs it expecting matches:

- A better optimisation level moves a body *toward* a match; it is not one. The level was
  chosen because it maximises word agreement, and word agreement is not objdiff's verdict.
  These functions still need source work, which is the model's job.
- The ledger makes this look far better than it is. `fn_12_23410` reads `best_percent 100.0`,
  and its saved best body really is a preserved link-failure reconstruction (finding 272).
  Scored honestly it is 75.0% by objdiff and 22.1% by word score at its recorded `-O2`.
  Word score cannot see pool matches -- a body whose private literals retarget to shared
  retail symbols scores low on words and high on objdiff -- so the two figures are not
  interchangeable, and this tool reports the word figure by construction.

Conclusion recorded rather than acted on: the 269 recorded levels are correctly applied and
worth nothing as a match source. The real lever on this population is source repair, which is
`fzgx sweep` / `fzgx fixup` territory -- except that finding 282 then measured the repair
engine against the whole >=99% band and got 0 matches from 40,208 candidates, so this
population is source work for a model session and nothing cheaper. Keep this command as the
staleness check it genuinely is -- one stale level out of 269 -- and not as a harvest.
