# The gate was raised from 1024 to 2048 on the evidence that "2-4KB is 0/10 and >4KB is
# 0/14". Re-measured over the whole fleet history that evidence is **8 functions, not 24**:
# only 8 above-2KB functions were ever first-touched (4 virgin, 4 near-miss), and none
# converted. That is too thin a sample to close 206 functions and 674,472 B -- **38% of all
# outstanding bytes** -- and it was self-sealing: the gate blocks exactly the functions needed to
# grow the sample.
#
# The real cost was never measured and is concrete. oc1's band is (2048, inf), so:
#
#     oc1 band inventory      214 functions
#     of those servable         8
#
# oc1 could not reach 206 virgin functions in its only band and had 0 virgin reachable. The
# fleet was not being protected from bad work above 2KB; one family was idle.
#
# Rather than move the gate on an 8-sample argument in either direction, the gate stands and a
# quarter of each batch is allowed past it as a **measured probe**. If those conversions land,
# the gate was wrong and should be raised. If they do not, the probe is the evidence the
# original claim never had. Either way the question gets answered with data instead of inherited
# numbers, and the probe is one constant to revert.
OVERSIZE_PROBE = 0.25
# A saved body that already diffs at this closeness is worth more per compile than
# a cold small function, so the size gate widens for it instead of excluding it
# outright.
#
# The gate was 1024B and was starving the fleet. Of the 610 functions this fleet had
# never actually attempted, 598 were blocked by it and only 12 were servable, so the
# "fresh work first" ordering in choose() had almost nothing fresh to order and the
# fleet fell through to whatever was left in base -- which is why the backlog looked
# exhausted. Measured over three days of fleet attempts, the 1-2KB band converts at
# 10.3% (6/58), which is indistinguishable from the 11.4% (370/3232) of the band the
# gate was written to protect. Beyond 2KB the evidence does not support opening it:
# 2-4KB is 0/10 and >4KB is 0/14. So the gate moves to 2048, where the data says yes,
# and stops there.
#
# The 1024B gate is a throughput heuristic, not a correctness rule: 51 near-misses

    A split range is a hard prerequisite for a body to land at all: without one,

    module, so a model session can produce a perfect body for a symbol that cannot
    be linked from C.

    `link_failed()` cannot catch this class: a symbol with no split range never
    reaches a link test, so it never records `link-mismatch` and is never retired.

    #
    # Measured 2026-10-05: 384 functions sit between 80% and 95%, 149 of them admitted by
    # ATTEMPT_CAP, and **choose() selected 0 of them for every family**. Not because they were

    # them, so with virgin-first ordering the queue never reaches it. Simulating the one-word
    # tier drained still gave 0/8, which rules out the tier as the cause and confirms the
    # virgin-first rule is. "Whatever is open" is therefore not true of this band: nothing in
    # the policy would ever pick it up.

    # best percent before the fleet first touched it:

    #     80-95%  378     >=99%   64
